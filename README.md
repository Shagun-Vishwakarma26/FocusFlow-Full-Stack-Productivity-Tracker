# FocusFlow-Full-Stack-Productivity-Tracker
FocusFlow is a full-stack ecosystem built for my CodTech internship. It features a Chrome Extension to track web activity, a Node.js backend for data processing, and a MongoDB database. With an interactive dashboard using Chart.js, users can visualize productive vs. distracting habits and export professional PDF reports.
